-----------------
1. Run Source Code
-----------------
Run test_higher_order.m file for Yale Face Data clustering using Hypergraph with large hyperedges. 

-----------------
2. Disclaimer
-----------------
This is a demo code of our ECCV 2014 paper. However, it has been extended from the actual description in the paper. 
It should give 100% clustering accuracy all the time, if not report to the authors.
